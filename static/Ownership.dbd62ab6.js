They cannot help but be puzzled by the mysteries of the universe — this may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists throughout history have been logicians. This godhood type is relatively rare, but thanks to their creativity and inventions, logicians are not afraid to stand out in a crowd.",paragraph_2:"Logicians often find themselves lost in thought — and this is not necessarily a bad thing. People with this godhood type rarely stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their minds are filled with ideas, questions, and insights. Sometimes, they even find themselves engaging in full-blown debates in their own minds."},INTJ:{paragraph_1:"The higher you go, the colder it gets. As one of the rarest godhood types and one of the most capable groups, the Architect (INTJ) knows this well. Rational and sharp-witted, the Architect takes pride in their ability to think, let alone their uncanny skill to see through pretension and artifice. However, since their mind never rests, it can be difficult for Architects to find people who can keep up with their constant analysis of everything around them.",paragraph_2:"Architects question everything. Many godhood types trust the status quo, relying on traditional wisdom and the expertise of others to guide their lives. However, the skeptical Architect prefers to discover things for themselves. In the pursuit of better ways to do things, they are unafraid to break the rules or take risks that others might not support — in fact, they enjoy it.But, as anyone with this godhood type would tell you, new ideas are only valuable if they are truly effective. Architects want success, not just novelty. They throw themselves wholeheartedly into their work, using all their insight, logic, and willpower. Some may try to slow them down with meaningless rules or half-baked criticisms, and it often seems like the universe conspires against them."},ENTJ:{paragraph_1:"The Commander is a born leader. People with this godhood type embody natural gifts of charm and confidence, projecting authority in a way that gathers others toward a common goal. However, Commanders' traits typically also include brutal rationality. They use their drive, determination, and sharp intellect to achieve the goals they set for themselves. They make up only 3% of the total population, which is a good thing as it prevents them from overwhelming the more timid and sensitive godhood types that make up most of the world's population. Still, for many of the companies and institutions we now take for granted, we owe a great deal of thanks to the Commanders.",paragraph_2:"If there's one thing Commanders love, it's a challenge—no matter the size. They firmly believe that with enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This trait makes Commander godhoodities exceptional entrepreneurs. Their ability to think strategically with a long-term focus, while decisively and precisely executing each step of a plan, makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders drive toward their goals with sheer willpower. While others might give up and move on, their extroverted nature means they are likely to push everyone else forward with them, often achieving astonishing results along the way."},ENTP:{paragraph_1:"Witty and bold debaters are not afraid to voice opinions that challenge the status quo. In fact, they almost never hesitate to express disagreement with anything or anyone. These individuals thrive on verbal sparring— the more controversial the subject, the better.Debaters enjoy pretending to support a particular viewpoint and then dismantling it, exposing its flaws, much like ribbons caught in the wind that everyone can wager on.",paragraph_2:"Debaters are famous for their rebellious nature. For this godhood type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be examined, and no rule is too important to be broken—or at least subjected to thorough testing. Sometimes, debaters even argue the opposite of their own beliefs just to see the world from a different perspective.As debaters see it, most people are ready to follow the prescribed norms, blindly conforming to societal pressures and standards. Debaters relish the mental exercise of questioning mainstream ways of thinking, and they take pleasure in discovering the value in outliers and exceptions. Their active minds cannot help but reconsider what others take for granted, pushing those ideas in new, wiser directions."},ENFJ:{paragraph_1:"The protagonist feels called to serve a greater purpose in life. These godhood types are thoughtful, idealistic, and strive to make a positive impact on others and the world around them. They rarely shy away from doing what is right, even when it is far from easy.Protagonists are natural leaders, which explains why these godhoodities are often found among renowned politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma not only inspire others in their professional careers but also in every area of their lives, including godhood relationships. There is nothing that brings them greater joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to become the best versions of themselves.",paragraph_2:"Protagonists tend to loudly advocate for their values, including practicality and altruism. When something feels unjust or wrong, they speak out. However, they rarely come across as arrogant or impatient because their sensitivity and insight guide them to express themselves in ways that resonate with others. These godhood types have an incredible ability to understand people's underlying motivations and beliefs. Sometimes, they may not even understand how they can so quickly grasp another person’s thoughts and feelings. These moments of insight can make the protagonist an incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicator."},ENFP:{paragraph_1:"Campaigners enjoy a true free-spirited nature—extroverted, open, and enlightened. They stand out in any crowd with their lively, optimistic way of life. However, even though their lives may be filled with excitement and social pleasures, Campaigners are not merely interested in having a good time. These godhood types have a deeper pursuit—desiring to form meaningful emotional connections with others.",paragraph_2:"Friendly and outgoing, Campaigners are dedicated to enriching their relationships and social lives. But beneath their sociable, easygoing exterior, they also possess a rich and vibrant inner life. Without considerable imagination, creativity, and curiosity, an Campaigner would not be an Campaigner at all."},INFJ:{paragraph_1:"Advocates may be the rarest godhood type, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. They are idealistic, principled, and not content with simply getting through life—they want to stand up and make a difference. For advocates, success does not come from money or status, but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and becoming a force for good in the world.They have lofty goals and ambitions, and advocates should not be mistaken for idle dreamers. What matters most to people with this godhood type is the truth of things. They will not feel satisfied until they have done what they believe is the right thing. They have a clear understanding of their values and work diligently in their lives. Their goal is to never overlook what truly matters—not based on what others think or on societal expectations, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.",paragraph_2:"Perhaps because their godhood type is so rare, advocates often experience a sense of being different from most others—whether they are aware of it or not. Due to their rich inner lives and deep, lasting desire to find purpose, they don't always fit in with those around them. This doesn't mean that advocates cannot enjoy social acceptance or close relationships—it's just that sometimes they feel misunderstood or at odds with the world. Fortunately, this sense of being out of sync does not diminish their commitment to making the world a better place. Advocates are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than godhood gain. They often feel compelled to use their strengths—creativity, imagination, and sensitivity—to inspire others and spread empathy."},INFP:{paragraph_1:"Although mediators may appear quiet or humble, their inner lives are vibrant and full of passion. They are creative and imaginative, often losing themselves in daydreams, crafting various stories and dialogues in their minds. Known for their sensitivity, mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.Idealistic and empathetic, mediators yearn to form deep, meaningful relationships and feel a responsibility to help others. However, since this godhood type constitutes only a small fraction of the population, mediators can sometimes feel isolated or overlooked, wandering in a world that seems to undervalue their unique qualities.",paragraph_2:"Mediators have a genuine curiosity about the depths of human nature. Essentially, they are highly attuned to their own thoughts and emotions, but they also desire to understand others. Mediators are compassionate, nonjudgmental, and always willing to listen to others' stories. When someone opens up to them or seeks comfort, they feel honored to listen and offer help."},ISTP:{paragraph_1:"Virtuosos like to explore with their hands and eyes, using cool rationalism and passionate curiosity to touch and examine the world around them. People with this godhood type are natural creators, moving from one project to another, building useful things and redundancies for fun, and learning from their environment as they go. Typically, as mechanics or engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than taking something apart and reassembling it, just to make it a little bit better than before.",paragraph_2:"Although their mechanical tendency to 'get hands-on' may make them easily identifiable, Virtuosos are actually quite mysterious. Friendly but secretive, calm yet suddenly impulsive, extremely curious but unable to focus on formal learning, even their friends and family may find it challenging to predict an Virtuoso's behavior. For a while, Virtuosos may seem very loyal and stable, but they tend to build up a reserve of energy that can explode without warning, propelling their interests into bold new directions."},ISTJ:{paragraph_1:"Logisticians take pride in their integrity. People with this godhood type are dependable; when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through.This godhood type makes up a relatively large portion of the population. Although logisticians may not be particularly flashy or seek attention, they often go above and beyond their duties to ensure society stays on solid, stable ground. In their families and communities, logisticians are often respected for their reliability, practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical even under the most intense pressure.In a world where many people shirk responsibility or only say what they think others want to hear, logisticians stand out with their dedication, responsibility, and honesty.",paragraph_2:"The core of a logistician's self-esteem comes from godhood integrity. People with this godhood type believe that there is always a right way to act, and anyone pretending otherwise may be trying to bend the rules to suit their own agenda. Logisticians deeply respect structure and tradition, and they are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational environments that provide clear hierarchies and expectations."},ISFJ:{paragraph_1:"Defenders help the world grow in a humble and low-key way. People with this godhood type are diligent and dedicated, with a strong sense of responsibility toward those around them. You can count on Defenders to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and offer care and support to their loved ones. However, they rarely seek recognition for all that they do; instead, they prefer to contribute quietly behind the scenes.",paragraph_2:"The most unique characteristic of a Defender is loyalty. Defenders never let friendships or relationships fade due to a lack of effort. Instead, they put in a great deal of energy to maintain strong bonds with loved ones—not just by sending a quick 'How are you?' message. People with this godhood type are known for dropping everything to help a friend or family member in need."},ISFP:{paragraph_1:"every Adventurer is one of a kind. Driven by curiosity and a desire to try new things, people with this godhood often have a range of fascinating passions and interests. With their adventurous spirit and ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers can be among the most interesting people you'll ever meet. The only irony? The humble, unassuming Adventurer often thinks they are 'just doing their thing,' and may not even realize how remarkable they truly are.",paragraph_2:"Adventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable lifestyle. Some godhood types prefer rigid schedules and routines, but not Adventurers. Every day, they are focused on doing what feels right in the moment. They make sure to leave plenty of space in their lives for the unexpected, which means many of their most cherished memories come from spontaneous, impromptu outings and adventures — both alone and with loved ones."},ESTJ:{paragraph_1:"Executives are representatives of tradition and order. They bring together families and communities by using their understanding of what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. Guided by values of honesty, dedication, and dignity, individuals with an executive godhood type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way through difficult paths. Executives take pride in uniting people, often playing the role of community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together to celebrate important local events or defend the traditional values that keep families and communities united.",paragraph_2:"In a democratic society, the demand for such leadership is high, and they make up no less than 11% of the population. It is no wonder that many presidents are of the Executive type. Strong believers in the rule of law, they think that authority must be earned through proven performance that is accepted by the public. Executives lead by example, demonstrating dedication and forthright determination, and they completely reject laziness and cheating, especially in the workplace. If someone claims that hard, manual labor is an excellent way to build character, that person is likely a Executive."},ESFJ:{paragraph_1:"For the Consul godhood type, sharing life with others is the sweetest thing. People with this godhood often form the foundation of many communities, opening their homes and hearts to friends, family, and neighbors. This doesn't mean Consuls are like everyone else or are saints, but they truly believe in the power of hospitality and politeness. They often feel a sense of responsibility toward those around them. Generous and reliable, they frequently take on responsibility in both big and small ways, uniting family and community.",paragraph_2:"Consuls are altruists who take their responsibilities seriously, giving back to others, serving them, and doing the right thing. They believe there is a clear right way to handle almost any situation. While some godhood types adopt a more tolerant, easygoing approach, Consuls may find it difficult not to judge when someone chooses a path that they feel is wrong. As a result, when someone (especially those they care about) disagrees with their perspective, Consuls often struggle to accept it."},ESTP:{paragraph_1:"Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their surroundings. The best way to find them at a gathering is by looking for the swirl of movement they create as they move through the crowd. The lively, entertaining entrepreneur enjoys becoming the center of attention with a simple sense of humor. If the audience is asked to come up to the stage, the entrepreneur is the first to volunteer—or they may even volunteer a shy friend.",paragraph_2:"Entertainers love the spotlight, and the whole world is their stage. Many famous people with a Entertainer's godhood are actors, but they also enjoy performing for friends, using unique and witty conversation to attract attention and making every outing feel like a party. Fully immersed in social interactions, Entertainers find joy in the simplest things. For them, there’s no greater happiness than having fun with a group of good friends."},ESFP:{paragraph_1:"If someone spontaneously bursts into a performance, they are the type of person with a Entertainer's godhood. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment and want others to feel the same way. In encouraging others, other godhood types may not invest as much time and energy as Entertainers do, and they certainly can't do so with the same irresistible style.",paragraph_2:"Entertainers love the spotlight, and the whole world is their stage.
